# Data Modeling with Postgres Project Sparkify Postgres ETL:
## Project Introduction:
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

My role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.
## Prerequisites:
This project makes the folowing assumptions:
- Python 3 installed,Python 3 Libraries available are given below:
    - pandas.
    - psycopg2.
    - os.
    - glob.
    - json.
- A PosgreSQL database is available on localhost.
- Jupyter Notebook is available.
## Datasets:
### Song Dataset:
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
    song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
`{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`
### Log Dataset:
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this  [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)  based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, I created a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis.This star schema has 1  _fact_  table (songplays), and 4  _dimension_  tables (users, songs, artists, time).

## Project Template:
Files used on the project:

-  **data**  folder nested at the home of the project, where all needed jsons reside.
-  **sql_queries.py**  contains all sql queries, and is imported into the files bellow.
-  **create_tables.py**  drops and creates tables. Run this file to reset your tables before running ETL scripts each time.
-  **test.ipynb**  displays the first few rows of each table to check database.
-  **etl.ipynb**  reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
-  **etl.py**  reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into tables.
-  **README.md**  current file, provides discussion on my project.
- **Python_Code_Execution.ipynb**  To execute *create_tables.py* and  *etl.py*.
## Steps Followed:
1. I wrote DROP, CREATE and INSERT query statements in *sql_queries.py*.
2. In *Python_Code_Execution.ipynb* I executed the following code block:
```
    %run 'create_tables.py'
```
3. I used *test.ipynb* Jupyter Notebook to interactively verify that all tables were created correctly.
4. I followed the instructions and completed *etl.ipynb* Notebook to create the blueprint of the pipeline to process and insert all data into the tables.
5. For the last step of *etl.ipynb* I wrote SELECT statement in *sql_queries.py*.
6. Once I  verified that base steps were correct by checking with *test.ipynb*, filled in *etl.py* program.
7. In *Python_Code_Execution.ipynb* I executed the following code block:
```
    %run 'create_tables.py'
    %run 'etl.py'
```
